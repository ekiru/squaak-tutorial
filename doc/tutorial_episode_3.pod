=head1 Episode 3: Squaak Details and First Steps

=head2 Introduction

In the previous episodes we introduced the Parrot Compiler Tools (PCT).
Starting from a high-level overview, we quickly created our own little scripting
language called I<Squaak>, using a Perl script provided with Parrot. We
discussed the general structure of PCT-based compilers, and each of the default
four transformation phases.
This third episode is where the Fun begins. In this episode, we shall introduce
the full specification of Squaak. In this and following episodes, we will
implement this specification step by step, in small increments that are easy to
digest. Once you get a feel for it, you'll notice implementing Squaak is almost
trivial, and most important, a lot of fun! So, let's get started!

=head2 Squaak Grammar

Without further ado, here is the full grammar specification for Squaak. This
specification uses the following meta-syntax:

    statement   indicates a non-terminal, named "statement"
    {statement} indicates zero or more statements
    [step]      indicates an optional step
    'do'        indicates the keyword 'do'

Below is Squaak's grammar. The start symbol is program.

    program              ::= {stat-or-def}

    stat-or-def          ::= statement
                           | sub-definition

    statement            ::= if-statement
                           | while-statement
                           | for-statement
                           | try-statement
                           | throw-statement
                           | variable-declaration
                           | assignment
                           | sub-call
                           | do-block

    block                ::= {statement}

    do-block             ::= 'do' block 'end'

    if-statement         ::= 'if' expression 'then' block
                             ['else' block]
                             'end'

    while-statement      ::= 'while' expression 'do'
                             block 'end'

    for-statement        ::= 'for' for-init ',' expression [step]
                             'do'
                             block
                             'end'

    step                 ::= ',' expression

    for-init             ::= 'var' identifier '=' expression

    try-statement        ::= 'try' block 'catch' identifier
                             block
                             'end'

    throw-statement      ::= 'throw' expression

    sub-definition       ::= 'sub' identifier parameters
                             block
                             'end'

    parameters           ::= '(' [identifier {',' identifier}] ')'

    variable-declaration ::= 'var' identifier ['=' expression]

    assignment           ::= primary '=' expression

    sub-call             ::= primary arguments

    primary              ::= identifier postfix-expression*

    postfix-expression   ::= key
                           | index
                           | member

    key                  ::= '{' expression '}'

    index                ::= '[' expression ']'

    member               ::= '.' identifier

    arguments            ::= '(' [expression {',' expression}] ')'

    expression           ::= expression {binary-op expression}
                           | unary-op expression
                           | '(' expression ')'
                           | term

    term                 ::= float-constant
                           | integer-constant
                           | string-constant
                           | array-constructor
                           | hash-constructor
                           | primary

    hash-constructor     ::= '{' [named-field {',' named-field}] '}'

    named-field          ::= string-constant '=>' expression

    array-constructor    ::= '[' [expression {',' expression} ] ']'

    binary-op            ::= '+'  | '-'  | '/'  | '*'  | '%'  | '..'
                           | 'and | 'or' | '>'  | '>=' | '<'  | '<='
                           | '==' | '!='

    unary-op             ::= 'not' | '-'

Gee, that's a lot, isn't it? Actually, this grammar is rather small compared to
"real world" languages such as C, not to mention Perl 6. No worries though, we
won't implement the whole thing at once, but in small steps. What's more, the
exercises section contains enough exercises for you to learn to use the PCT
yourself! The solutions to these exercises will be posted a few days later (but
you really only need a couple of hours to figure them out).

=head2 Semantics

Most of the Squaak language is straightforward; the if-statement executes
exactly as you would expect. When we discuss a grammar rule (for its
implementation), a semantic specification will be included. This is to prevent
myself from writing a complete language manual, which could take some pages.

=head2 Interactive Squaak

Although the Squaak compiler can be used in interactive mode, there is one point
of attention to be noted. When defining a local variable using the C<var>
keyword, this variable will be lost in any consecutive commands. The variable
will only be available to other statements within the same command (a command is
a set of statements before you press enter). This has to do with the code
generation by the PCT, and will be fixed at a later point. For now, just
remember it doesn't work.

=head2 Let's get started!

In the rest of this episode we will implement the basic parts of the grammar,
such as the basic data types and assignments. At the end of this episode,
you'll be able to assign simple values to (global) variables. It ain't much, but
it's a very important first step. Once these basics are in place, you'll notice
that adding a certain syntactic construct becomes a matter of minutes.

First, open your editor and open the files F<src/parser/grammar.pg> and
F<src/parser/actions.pm>. The former implements the parser using Perl 6 rules,
and the latter contains the parse actions, which are executed during the parsing
stage.

In the file grammar.pg, you'll see the top-level rule, named C<TOP>. It's
located at, ehm... the top. When the parser is invoked, it will start at this
rule (a rule is nothing else than a method of the grammar class).
When we generated this language (in the first episode), some default rules were
defined. Now we're going to make some small changes, just enough to get us
started. Firstly, change the statement rule to this:

    rule statement {
        <assignment>
        {*}
    }

and add these rules:

    rule assignment {
        <primary> '=' <expression>
        {*}
    }

    rule primary {
        <identifier>
        {*}
    }

    token identifier {
        <!keyword> <ident>
        {*}
    }

    token keyword {
        ['and'|'catch'|'do'   |'else' |'end' |'for' |'if'
        |'not'|'or'   |'sub'  |'throw'|'try' |'var'|'while']>>
    }

Now, change the rule "value" into this (renaming to "expression"):

    rule expression {
        | <string_constant> {*}        #= string_constant
        | <integer_constant> {*}       #= integer_constant
    }

Rename the rule C<integer> as C<integer_constant>, and C<quote> as
C<string_constant> (to better match our language specification).

Phew, that was a lot of information! Let's have a closer look at some things
that may look unfamiliar. The first new thing is in the rule C<identifier>.
Instead of the C<rule> keyword, you see the keyword C<token>. In short, a token
doesn't skip whitespace between the different parts specified in the token,
while a rule does. For now, it's enough to remember to use a token if you want
to match a string that doesn't contain any whitespace (such as literal constants
and identifiers), and use a rule if your string does (and should) contain
whitespace (such as a an if-statement). We shall use the word C<rule> in a
general sense, which could refer to a token. For more information on rules and
tokens (and there's a third type, called C<regex>), take a look at synopsis 5.

In token C<identifier>, the first subrule is called an assertion. It asserts
that an C<identifier> does not match the rule keyword. In other words, a keyword
cannot be used as an identifier. The second subrule is called C<ident>, which is
a built-in rule in the class C<PCT::Grammar>, of which this grammar is a
subclass.

In token C<keyword>, all keywords of Squaak are listed. At the end there's a
C<<< >> >>> marker, which indicates a word boundary. Without this marker, an
identifier such as "forloop" would wrongly be disqualified, because the part
"for" would match the rule keyword, and the part "loop" would match the rule
"ident". However, as the assertion <!keyword> is false (as "for" could be
matched), the string "forloop" cannot be matched as an identifier. The required
presence of the word boundary prevents this.

The last rule is C<expression>. An expression is either a string-constant or an
integer-constant. Either way, an action is executed. However, when the action is
executed, it does not know what the parser matched; was it a string-constant, or
an integer-constant? Of course, the match object can be checked, but consider
the case where you have 10 alternatives, then doing 9 checks only to find out
the last alternative was matched is somewhat inefficient (and adding new
alternatives requires you to update this check). That's why you see the special
comments starting with a "#=" character. Using this notation, you can specify a
key, which will be passed as a second argument to the action method. As we will
see, this allows us to write very simple and efficient action methods for rules
such as expression. (Note there's a space between the C<#=> and the key's name).

=head2 Testing the Parser

It is useful to test the parser before writing any action methods. This can save
you a lot of work; if you write the actions immediately after writing the
grammar rules, and only later find out that your parser must be updated, then
your action methods probably need to be updated as well.
In Episode 2 we saw the target command line option. In order to test the parser,
the "parse" target is especially helpful. When specifying this option, your
compiler will print the parse tree of your input string, or print a syntax
error. It is wise to test your parser with both correct and incorrect input, so
you know for sure your parser doesn't accept input that it shouldn't.

=head2 And... Action!

Now we have implemented the initial version of the Squaak grammar, it's time to
implement the parse actions we mentioned before. The actions are written in a
file called F<src/parser/actions.pm>. If you look at the methods in this file,
here and there you'll see that the match object ($/) , or rather, hash fields of
it (like $<statement>) is evaluated in scalar context, by writing "$( ... )".
As mentioned in Synopsis 5, evaluating a Match object in scalar context returns
its result object. Normally the result object is the matched portion of the
source text, but the special make function can be used to set the result object
to some other value.
This means that each node in the parse tree (a Match object) can also hold its
PAST representation. Thus we use the make function to set the PAST
representation of the current node in the parse tree, and later use the $( ... )
operator to retrieve the PAST representation from it.

In recap, the match object ($/) and any subrules of it (for instance
$<statement>) represent the parse tree; of course, $<statement>
represents only the parse tree what the $<statement> rule matched. So, any
action method has access to the parse tree that the equally named grammar rule
matched, as the match object is always passed as an argument. Evaluating a parse
tree in scalar context yields the PAST representation (obviously, this PAST
object should be set using the make function).

If you're following this tutorial, I highly advise you to get your feet wet, and
do the exercises. Remember, learning and not doing is not learning (or something
like that :-). This week's exercises are not that difficult, and after doing
them, you'll have implemented the first part of our little Squaak language.

=head2 What's next?

In this episode we introduced the full grammar of Squaak. We took the first
steps to implement this language. The first, and currently only, statement type
is assignments. We briefly touched on how to write the action methods that are
invoked during the parsing phase.
In the next episode, we shall take a closer look on the different PAST node
types, and implement some more parts of the Squaak language. Once we have all
basic parts in place, adding statement types will be rather straightforward.
In the mean time, if you have any questions or are stuck, don't hesitate to
leave a comment or contact me.

=head2 Exercises

This episode's exercises are simple enough to get started on implementing
Squaak.

=over 4

=item 1.

Rename the names of the action methods according to the name changes we made on
the grammar rules. So, "integer" becomes "integer_constant", "value" becomes
"expression", and so on.

=item 2.

Look at the grammar rule for statement. A statement currently consists of an
assignment. Implement the action method "statement" to retrieve the result
object of this assignment and set it as statement's result object using the
special make function. Do the same for rule primary.

=item 3.

Write the action method for the rule identifier. As a result object of this
"match", a new PAST::Var node should be set, taking as name a string
representation of the match object ($/). For now, you can set the scope to
'package'. See "pdd26: ast" for details on PAST::Var nodes.

=item 4.

Write the action method for assignment. Retrieve the result objects for
"primary" and for "expression", and create a PAST::Op node that binds the
expression to the primary. (Check out pdd26 for PAST::Op node types, and find
out how you do such a binding).

=item 5.

Run your compiler on a script or in interactive mode. Use the target option to
see what PIR is being generated on the input "x = 42".

=back

=head2 Some Notes

=over 4

=item * Help! I get the error message "no result object".

This means that the result object was not set properly (duh!).
Make sure each action method is invoked (check each rule for a "{*}" marker),
and that there is an action method for that rule, and that "make" is used to set
the appropriate PAST node. Note that not all rules have action methods, for
instance the C<keyword> rule (there's no point in that).

=item * While we're constructing parts of Squaak's grammar, we'll sometimes
make a shortcut, by forgetting about certain rules for a while. For instance,
you might have noticed we're ignoring float-constants right now. That's ok. When
we'll need them, these rules will be added.

=head2 Solutions to the exercises

By now, you may have finished the PCT tutorial. If you felt too lazy to do the
exercises or if you want to see what solution I had in mind, here are the
solutions to the exercises in Episode 3 (Episode 1's exercise was discussed at
the end of Episode 2, and the latter didn't have any coding assignments).

=over 4

=item 1

Rename the names of the action methods according to the name changes we made
on the grammar rules. So, "integer" becomes "integer_constant", "value" becomes
"expression", and so on.

I assume you don't need any help with this.

=item 2

Look at the grammar rule for statement. A statement currently consists of an
assignment. Implement the action method "statement" to retrieve the result
object of this assignment and set it as statement's result object using the
special make function. Do the same for rule primary.

 method statement($/) {
     make $( $<assignment> );
 }

Note that at this point, the rule statement doesn't define different #= keys
for each type of statement, so we don't declare a parameter C<$key>. This will
be changed later.

 method primary($/) {
     make $( $<identifier> );
 }

=item 3

Write the action method for the rule identifier. As a result object of this
"match", a new C<PAST::Var> node should be set, taking as name a string
representation of the match object ($/). For now, you can set the scope to
'package'. See "pdd26: ast" for details on C<PAST::Var> nodes.

 method identifier($/) {
     make PAST::Var.new( :name(~$/), :scope('package'), :node($/) );
 }

=item 4

Write the action method for assignment. Retrieve the result objects for
"primary" and for "expression", and create a C<PAST::Op> node that binds the
expression to the primary. (Check out pdd26 for C<PAST::Op> node types, and
find out how you do such a binding).

 method assignment($/) {
     my $lhs := $( $<primary> );
     my $rhs := $( $<expression> );
     $lhs.lvalue(1);
     make PAST::Op.new( $lhs, $rhs, :pasttype('bind'), :node($/) );
 }

Note that we set the lvalue flag on $lhs. See PDD26 for details on this flag.

=item 5

Run your compiler on a script or in interactive mode. Use the target option to
see what PIR is being generated on the input "x = 42".

 .namespace.sub "_block10"
   new $P11, "Integer"
   assign $P11, 42
   set_global "x", $P11
   .return ($P11)
 .end

The first two lines of code in the sub create an object to store the number 42,
the third line stores this number as "x". The PAST compiler will always
generate an instruction to return the result of the last statement, in this
case C<$P11>.
